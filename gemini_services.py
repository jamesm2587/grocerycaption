    "Store Name: [Use visual logos as the primary clue, making sure to to notice any small letters that might not make sense for example the I in Mi Tiendita. If you see a prominent logo (like a large letter 'R'), you MUST prioritize identifying a store with that letter (e.g., 'RRanch Market'), even if the full text is not perfectly clear.
